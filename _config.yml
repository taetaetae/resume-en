about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  As a backend developer with 12 years of experience, I have worked on operating and developing web services that handle large-scale traffic, managing over 10 million users, processing massive amounts of data, and supporting both domestic and global services. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and structuring complex systems with organization and attention to detail. By ensuring code consistency, optimizing performance, and addressing technical debt, I proactively prevent and resolve potential issues during the development process.
  I am particularly interested in fostering a culture where not only individual growth but also the entire team grows together.
  Currently, as a senior developer within my organization, I am dedicated to troubleshooting, performance optimization, and designing high-performance APIs to contribute to business growth.

          **NAVER Shopping**ㆍ[*https://shopping.naver.com*](https://shopping.naver.com)ㆍ<small>(Feb 2022 – Present)</small><br>
          - Developed product APIs for a new Quick Commerce service and established layer architecture/test code conventions within the development task force.<br>
            ㆍ Background: Ambiguous module responsibilities caused by indiscriminate inter-layer calls, along with frequent regressions due to a lack of test codes.<br> 
            ㆍ Actions:<br>
              ㆍEstablished clear layer separation through refactoring and proposed it as a development convention within the team.<br> 
              ㆍIntegrated ArchUnit-based fitness functions into the CI pipeline to automatically detect dependency violations between layers.<br>
              ㆍDocumented unit test best practices and provided sample codes to facilitate easy adoption by team members.<br> 
              ㆍResulted in improved code quality and maintainability.<br>
              ㆍLeadership and collaboration: Regular scrums with product data source teams, client (Front-End) teams, and planning/design departments.<br>
            ㆍ Outcome: Successfully prioritized tasks and coordinated schedules to stably release new features by deadlines.<br>
            <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
            
          - Built a real-time monitoring system for handling large-scale traffic and responding to incidents during the operation of the Fashion Town service.<br> 
          ㆍ Background: Incident responses were delayed by over 5 minutes on average due to manual log analysis.<br> 
          ㆍ Actions:<br>
            ㆍCollected metrics using Nginx VTS Module + Prometheus and established real-time traffic analysis via Grafana dashboards.<br>
            ㆍApplied Nginx Rate Limit settings (with dry_run testing first) to block abnormal traffic and prevent performance degradation.<br>
            ㆍVisualized application metrics (response time, DB query speed, etc.) to identify and prioritize bottleneck improvements.<br> 
          ㆍ Outcome: Reduced incident detection and response time from 5 minutes to under 1 minute by integrating alerts and log analysis.<br>
          <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>

          - Developed the Product Standardization ('Group Product') service and designed a data pipeline.<br> 
          ㆍ Background: Multiple options of the same product were registered separately, lowering search accuracy and confusing users.<br> 
          ㆍ Actions:<br>
            ㆍOptimized duplicate removal and filtering/paging performance using ElasticSearch's collapse queries.<br>
            ㆍImplemented logic to expose representative products within a group based on priority policies.<br>
            ㆍDesigned and led migration of the product reception data pipeline between MongoDB and ElasticSearch.<br>
            ㆍConducted load testing to verify performance against TPS targets and improved query strategies.<br>
            ㆍCollaborated with product data teams and QA to detect and resolve missing or inconsistent data issues.<br>
          ㆍ Outcome:<br>
            ㆍLed task management and risk identification to successfully complete the project within the deadline.<br>
            ㆍReduced product management workload for operational consultants.<br>
          <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>

          - Built a high-availability data pipeline for processing large-scale real-time user events.<br>
          ㆍ Background: Needed to implement personalized product recommendations and real-time ranking/feed services based on user behavior.<br> 
          ㆍ Actions:<br> 
            ㆍProcessed real-time streaming data based on Kafka to analyze user events and link to recommendation systems.<br> 
            ㆍTransitioned from a batch-based (hourly) ranking system to near-real-time ranking using Redis (improving freshness).<br> 
          ㆍ Outcome: Contributed to a 10% increase in page views after service launch.<br>
          <div style="height: 1em;"></div>
