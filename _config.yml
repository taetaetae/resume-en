          **NAVER Shopping**ㆍ[*https://shopping.naver.com*](https://shopping.naver.com)ㆍ<small>(Feb 2022 – Present)</small><br>
          - Developed key service APIs and operated data pipelines<br>
          - Designed and implemented a real-time traffic monitoring system for handling large-scale traffic and incident response<br>
          ㆍ The previous incident response method (log analysis-based) was inefficient, with an average response time of over 5 minutes<br>
          ㆍ Established a metric-based real-time traffic monitoring system using Nginx VTS module and Prometheus (applied after dry_run validation)<br>
          ㆍ Implemented Nginx Rate Limit settings to block abnormal traffic and ensure a stable traffic handling environment<br>
          ㆍ Collected metrics (Prometheus + Grafana) and built dashboards to analyze response times and database query performance for bottleneck identification<br>
          ㆍ Built a traffic dashboard using the ELK stack with access logs, reducing analysis time<br>
          - Introduced incident recovery strategies and Chaos Engineering to enhance service stability<br>
          ㆍ Defined failure recovery scenarios and conducted replication tests before service launch<br>
          ㆍ Implemented a fallback cache to mitigate empty response issues caused by external response delays when the remote cache (Redis) expired<br>
          ㆍ Introduced Chaos Engineering (Toxiproxy) to replicate latency failures and validate fallback cache logic through retry and connection recovery<br>
          ㆍ Discovered fallback cache defects (failure in switching to recovery mode) through failure testing, optimized it, and achieved six months of zero downtime post-launch<br>
          - Built a high-availability data pipeline for large-scale real-time user event processing<br>
          ㆍ Implemented personalized recommendations and real-time ranking/feed services based on user behavior<br>
          ㆍ Utilized Kafka for real-time streaming data processing, enabling user event analysis and integration with the recommendation system<br>
          ㆍ Migrated from a batch-based ranking system (hourly updates) to near real-time ranking calculation using Redis (improving freshness)<br>

          **V LIVE**ㆍ[*http://www.vlive.tv*](http://www.vlive.tv/)ㆍ<small>(Aug 2018 – Feb 2022)</small><br>
          - Improved push notification speed for 10 million users (from 11 minutes to 30 seconds), enhancing push notification system performance by 95% ([*Related blog post*](https://taetaetae.github.io/2019/01/02/faster-parallel-processes/))<br>
          ㆍ Identified issues in the existing process, led planning and design, implemented, and deployed in three phases<br>
          ㆍ Optimized recipient query methods and improved message queue (RabbitMQ) parallel processing, enhancing speed<br>
          ㆍ Reduced Redis load and increased processing speed by implementing Redis key partitioning to control duplicate notifications<br>
          - Full-scale service overhaul: Transitioned from Monolithic to MSA architecture to enhance scalability and fault isolation<br>
          ㆍ Applied EDA, Circuit Breaker, and module separation to reduce inter-service coupling and enable fault isolation<br>
          ㆍ Introduced Kubernetes-based container orchestration for deployment flexibility<br>
          - Automated CI/CD and improved code quality by integrating SonarQube for static analysis and implementing online code reviews ([*Related blog post*](https://taetaetae.github.io/2018/02/08/jenkins-sonar-github-integration/))<br>
          - Applied batch non-disruptive deployment to maintain service continuity and minimize failures ([*Related blog post*](https://taetaetae.github.io/2019/10/13/batch-nondisruptive-deploy/))<br>

          **NAVER Pay – Card Direct Merchant System (Payment Gateway)**ㆍ<small>(Apr 2016 – Aug 2018)</small><br>
          - Set up the initial project environment (build/deployment pipelines, CI/CD design, server and infrastructure configuration)<br>
          - Built a business-integrated monitoring system using the Elastic Stack for automated service failure detection and anomaly detection ([*Related blog post*](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/3585246))<br>
          - Developed a transaction decline monitoring system to automatically detect abnormal transaction patterns and establish a response system ([*Related blog post*](https://taetaetae.github.io/2018/05/31/anomaly-detection/))<br>
          - Enhanced payment system stability by implementing distributed tracing for transaction tracking and performance monitoring<br>

          **NAVER Weather**ㆍ[*https://weather.naver.com*](https://weather.naver.com/)ㆍ<small>(May 2014 – Apr 2016)</small><br>
          - Developed a monitoring tool for content provider (CP) data reception to verify data integrity and automate failure detection<br>
          - Migrated data collection from Crontab-based scheduling to Spring Batch and Jenkins, enabling data flow visualization and operational automation<br>
          - Established a data pipeline logging system to detect anomalies and improve processing delays<br>
          - Conducted ideation and prototyping for a map-based weather service, which was later applied to the service<br>
